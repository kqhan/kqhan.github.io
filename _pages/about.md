I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at UCLA advised by Prof. Yizhou Sun.

I received my CS bachelor degree at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Yang Yang at AINet Lab. Fortunately, I also receive guidance from Prof. Carl Yang at Emory Graph Mining Lab.

I am excited to discuss and collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Please feel free to email me at: kqhan@cs.ucla.edu
