I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at UCLA advised by Prof. Yizhou Sun.

I received my CS bachelor degree at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Yang Yang at AINet Lab. Fortunately, I also receive guidance from Prof. Carl Yang at Emory Graph Mining Lab.

I am excited to discuss and collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Please feel free to email me at: kqhan@cs.ucla.edu 

Recent Research

LLM reasoning
======
the common theme is improving LLM reasoning by tackling challenges in robustness, structure, and efficiency.

In CR-WSC, I expose vulnerabilities in LLMs' reasoning through adversarial evaluation, showing how subtle concept changes can lead to errors.
In GraphLLM, I address LLMs' poor performance on structured graph data, integrating graph learning models for better reasoning.
With GraphAdapter, I focus on efficiency, combining GNNs with LLMs to handle text-attributed graphs with minimal computational cost.
